\n\nConnect Four (also known as Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four,
and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose
a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of
one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.\n\n""")

\n\nPopOut starts the same as traditional gameplay, with an empty board and players alternating turns placing 
their own colored discs into the board. During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top or,
if one has any discs of his or her own color on the bottom row, remove (or "pop out") a disc of one's own color
from the bottom. Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, changing their
relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection.

one of their own color discs into the slots filling up only the bottom row, then moving on to the next row
until it is filled, and so forth until all rows have been filled. Gameplay works by players taking turns
removing a disc of one's own color through the bottom of the board. If the disc that was removed was part
of a four-disc connection at the time of its removal, the player sets it aside out of play and immediately
takes another turn. If it was not part of a "connect four", then it must be placed back on the board through
a slot at the top into any open space in an alternate column (whenever possible) and the turn ends,
switching to the other player. The first player to set aside ten discs of his or her color wins the game.\n\n""")

pieces, which each player may choose to play once per game. When playing a piece marked with an anvil icon,
for example, the player may immediately pop out all pieces below it, leaving the anvil piece at the bottom
row of the game board. Other marked game pieces include one with a wall icon, allowing a player to play 
a second consecutive non winning turn with an unmarked piece; a "Ã—2" icon, allowing for an unrestricted
second turn with an unmarked piece; and a bomb icon, allowing a player to immediately pop out an opponent's piece.\n\n""")
